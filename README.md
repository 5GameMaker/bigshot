# BIG SHOT

Do you wanna be a BIG SHOT?

`bigshot` is a quick alternative to `flameshot` where `flameshot` doesn't work. Bind `bigshot` to `PrintScr` and press Print Screen. Select a region using mouse and press Enter to copy screenshot to clipboard or your close app bind to cancel.

## `bigshot` vs `grimshot`
`grimshot` only creates a screenshot after you select an area which can be troublesome in a lot of cases, mine in particular, this is why this exists.

## OS/WM/Compositor support
For now the only supported desktop is Hyprland under Linux, though PRs are welcome.

## Contributing
`bigshot` licensed under MIT and all contributions must be licensed under MIT. It's advised to create tracking issues prior to starting working on the PR.

## Project goals
A working screenshotter. What more do you need? Maybe a stable API too.
